# Clock App

This is my take on the timer project. The UI is straightforward, but account for all ac. The clocks can be controlled from the buttons alongside the clocks or via the console.

The project does not use outside libraries (besides tooling) to limit the size as much as possible. The project riffs on ideas found in redux, and has templating abstracted to simple render/component flow.

Some tests were added to pure functions, to demonstrate how the project can be tested, although there are a number of additional non-happy path tests that could be added.

To get going:
`yarn install`
`make build`
`make`
